# Over-Speeding Detection Project

This project detects over-speeding vehicles in video feeds using YOLOv8 and DeepSORT.

## Setup

1. Create a Python environment and install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download YOLOv8 weights (e.g., yolov8n.pt) and place it in the project root.

3. Replace `video_samples/sample_video_placeholder.mp4` with your traffic video.

4. Run the script:
```
python overspeeding_detection.py
```

Press 'q' to exit the video window.
